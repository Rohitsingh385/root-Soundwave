    2) create a .env file in the server folder
       write 
         OPENAI_API_ KEY = "your api key";

    3) headback to the script file and change the
       the fetch url to localhost

    4) now cd to client folder and run `npm
       install `

    5) run `npm run dev`

    6) Now go back to the server folder

    7) run `npm install cors dotenv express
       nodemon openai`

    8) finally run `npm run server to run the 
       server.
       
       NOTE : make sure to run the `dev and server
              ` simultaneously.
